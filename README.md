[![CI](https://github.com/Coteh/adventofcode2020/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Coteh/adventofcode2020/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code (AoC) 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

At work, we had been using Elixir for some backend services, which made me want to deepen my familiarity with the language. That’s how I ended up choosing it for this year’s Advent of Code.

## Running the Solutions

Each day is implemented in a separate file. (or in the case of Days 01-08, one file for each part)

You can run them like this:

```sh
elixir <day>/<solution_file>.ex <input_file>
```

Example:

```
./run.sh 01/Day01-1.ex 01/input
```

To run the test suite:

```
./test.sh
```

## Progress

|  12  |        |        |
|  13  |        |        |
|  14  |        |        |
|  15  |        |        |
|  16  |        |        |
|  17  |        |        |
|  18  |        |        |
|  19  |        |        |
|  20  |        |        |
|  21  |        |        |
|  22  |        |        |
|  23  |        |        |
|  24  |        |        |
|  25  |        |        |

\* Day 11 part 2 is incredibly slow at the moment. Will need to see if it can be optimized later.
